🎓 Study a word by adding to a SRS deck you create, using SQLite to store your cards (words you study) & FreeSRS to repeat them to increasing intervals in the most efficient way to remember them 🔄

</> Use this in your own app, website or other project! All code written here is licesensed under the GPL3, allowing free use & modification as long as the same license is used for the derivative work, while the LitJS components are available as a javascript library, ***lawcos*** you are free to use. LitJS was choosen mainly as it requires no JavaScript bundler or compiler, allowing anyone to easily read the site's code using browser dev tools (or use it in their own JS file!), unlike intentionally obfuscated sites designed by large corporations. 🔗
